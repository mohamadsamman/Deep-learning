Also, let\n","$T$ be our tag set, and $y_i$ the tag of word $w_i$.\n","Denote our prediction of the tag of word $w_i$ by\n","$\\hat{y}_i$.\n","\n","This is a structure prediction, model, where our output is a sequence\n","$\\hat{y}_1, \\dots, \\hat{y}_M$, where $\\hat{y}_i \\in T$.\n","\n","To do the prediction, pass an LSTM over the sentence. Denote the hidden\n","state at timestep $i$ as $h_i$. Also, assign each tag a\n","unique index (like how we had word\\_to\\_ix in the word embeddings\n","section). Then our prediction rule for $\\hat{y}_i$ is\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\hat{y}_i = \\text{argmax}_j \\  (\\log \\text{Softmax}(Ah_i + b))_j\\end{align}\n","\n","That is, take the log softmax of the affine map of the hidden state,\n","and the predicted tag is the tag that has the maximum value in this\n","vector.
